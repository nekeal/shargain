# 3. User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
The public-facing MVP will establish the definitive "v1" design system for the project. We will use **shadcn/ui** components as the foundation to ensure a consistent and high-quality look and feel.

### Modified/New Screens and Views
*   Login & Registration Pages
*   Main Dashboard (for viewing and managing tracked URLs)
*   A form for adding/editing a tracked URL
*   User Account/Settings Page (primarily for connecting a Telegram account)

### UI Consistency Requirements
A consistent look and feel must be maintained across all screens, including colors, typography, spacing, and component styles. The user flow must be logical, simple, and seamless.
