# 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview
*   **Analysis Source**: This PRD is based on the detailed technical analysis found in `docs/project-architecture.md`.
*   **Current Project State**: The project is a nearly complete offer notification system, currently in a closed beta. The immediate goal is to formalize the application, finalize MVP features, and prepare for a public launch and subsequent monetization.

### Available Documentation Analysis
The `document-project` task has provided us with a solid baseline for technical documentation.
*   [x] Tech Stack Documentation
*   [x] Source Tree/Architecture
*   [x] API Documentation (via OpenAPI spec)
*   [ ] *Coding Standards (inferred from code, but not an explicit document)*
*   [ ] *External API Documentation (e.g., for Telegram)*
*   [ ] *UX/UI Guidelines*

### Enhancement Scope Definition
*   **Enhancement Type**: This work can be classified as a **Major Feature Modification** and **UI/UX Overhaul** as we move from a private beta to a public-facing product.
*   **Enhancement Description**: The project is to take the existing closed-beta application, harden its features, polish the user experience, and add the necessary components for a public launch.
*   **Impact Assessment**: This will have a **Significant Impact**, as it will likely involve refactoring, hardening existing code, and adding new public-facing features.

### User Personas

*   **Primary: "The Power Hunter"**: Highly motivated individuals competing for time-sensitive items (e.g., apartment hunting). They need to be faster than the competition and are frustrated by manual, repetitive checking of multiple websites.
*   **Secondary: "The Casual Searcher"**: Individuals with a specific, one-time need (e.g., looking for a used bicycle). They need a simple "set it and forget it" tool and are easily discouraged by manual monitoring.

### Goals and Background Context
*   **Goals**:
    *   Successfully launch the application to the public.
    *   Achieve the initial user adoption and retention KPIs defined in the Project Brief.
    *   Establish a stable and scalable foundation for future monetization.
*   **Background Context**: The application has been developed to a near-complete state. This effort bridges the gap between a functional prototype and a polished, reliable, and marketable product ready for public use.

### Success Metrics

*   **User Adoption**: Achieve 100 daily active users within 3 months of launch.
*   **User Retention**: Attain a month-over-month retention rate of at least 40% for the first 6 months.
*   **User Satisfaction**: Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 50+ from active users.
*   **Engagement**: Track Daily Active Users (DAU), Monthly Active Users (MAU), and the average number of tracked URLs per user.
*   **Notification Value**: Measure the Click-Through Rate (CTR) on notifications to ensure they are relevant and timely.
