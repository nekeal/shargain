# Product Context: Application for following websites for new offers

## Problem Statement
Users often miss valuable offers because they are scattered across multiple sources or platforms. Often, the best offers are available for a short period of time, and users miss them because they are not aware of their existence. Also, some products are not available for a long time, and it's hard for the user to check all the time. This application centralizes offer discovery and notification, ensuring users never miss out.

**Key Problems:**
- Fragmented offer information
- Manual searching is time-consuming
- Missed opportunities due to lack of timely alerts

## User Experience Goals
- Aggregates offers
- Notifies users instantly
- Saves time and increases value for end-users
- Provides a visually clear, accessible Telegram interface (HTML formatting, clickable links, emojis)
- Supports multiple languages (i18n) for all user-facing messages

## Success Metrics
- High user retention rate
- Positive user feedback and reviews
- Growth in the number of active users
- High notification open and click-through rates

## Subscription Model

The subscription model will be based on two main factors: the number of scraping URLs a user can have and the number of notifications they can receive per month.

## User Activity Tracking

To track user engagement, we will implement the following methods:

1.  **Offer URL Clicks:** Track when a user clicks on an offer URL in a notification.
2.  **"Seen" Offers:** Track when a user has seen an offer.
