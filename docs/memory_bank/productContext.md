# Product Context: Application for following websites for new offers

## Problem Statement
Users often miss valuable offers because they are scattered across multiple sources or platforms. Often, the best offers are available for a short period of time, and users miss them because they are not aware of their existence. Also, some products are not available for a long time, and it's hard for the user to check all the time. This application centralizes offer discovery and notification, ensuring users never miss out.

**Key Problems:**
- Fragmented offer information
- Manual searching is time-consuming
- Missed opportunities due to lack of timely alerts

## User Experience Goals
- Aggregates offers
- Notifies users instantly
- Saves time and increases value for end-users
