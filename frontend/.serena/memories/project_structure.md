The project follows a standard React project structure. The main application code is in the `src` directory. Routes are defined in the `src/routes` directory using a file-based routing system. The `__root.tsx` file in the `src/routes` directory serves as the layout for all routes. The `public` directory contains static assets. The `docs` directory contains project documentation. The `src/lib/api` directory contains the auto-generated API client from the OpenAPI specification and should not be modified manually.
